# awesome-flipperzero-pack

Downloadable zip files for all [awesome-flipperzero](https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero) resources ready to put in your microSD.

## Last release

See <https://github.com/katlol/awesome-flipperzero-pack/releases/latest>

### microsd.zip

the idea is to unpack the microsd zip and put it in the flipper's microsd

### microsd-wavplayer.zip

microsd-wavplayer is part of the UberGuidoZ/Flipper repo, but as it's about 2GB, and github releases max is 2GB, it's split off its own zip.

### tweaks.zip

All the other files from the awesome-flipperzero list that do not belong on an SD card, 3D printed cases, and other tooling that does not run on the Flipper.
